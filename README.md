This is a common complaint. Although home-based treatments can provide temporary relief, they hardly ever address:
Wall or pipe placement for nesting zones
Some insects have large egg masses and can produce 50 eggs at once
Extermination based on sources, such as termite nests beneath the flooring, is not an option
Only certified pest control professionals possess the necessary tools and chemicals to eliminate the root cause.
